Hi there! I'm Gert Lombard. I'm a Software Engineer at Twitter.

**Life:** I'm a South African currently living and working in San Francisco with my family. I've also lived in Ireland and Copenhagen.

**Software:** I've been programming since 1989. I started in GW-Basic then Turbo Basic, then switched to Turbo Pascal and Assembly Language in 1990. Switched to C++ in 1992. I graduated from the University of Pretoria in 1996 (B. Sc. Information Technology) and started working in 1997, writing software for the air transport industry. I have since dabbled in various languages and technologies: Web development, Perl, PHP, Delphi, WebSphere Message Broker, recently .NET / C# and now Android.

**Interests:** I have a strong desire to CREATE. To create ANYTHING. I have too many ideas for web sites or hobby projects and too little time. I want to learn to play guitar. I want to learn to use a camera properly. I want to blog about topics that interest me like software development. I want to join a local Skeptics In The Pub group. The only thing stronger than my desire to create, is the debilitating strive for "perfection" which can sometimes lead to analysis paralysis. That combined with the demands of our two busy kids, means I'm not making as much progress with my hobbies as I'd like. But watch this space: someday I'm going to do something awesome!
