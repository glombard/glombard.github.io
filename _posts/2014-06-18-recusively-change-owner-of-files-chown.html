I've just changed my OS X / Mac main user - I've created a new 'coder' user account that I want to use for development instead of my old 'lombard' account. I realized that a lot of my applications I've previously installed via Homebrew now had to be changed to be owned by the new coder user.  First I ran 'brew doctor' find see what obvious issues I have:  <pre><code>Gerts-Mac-mini:src coder$ brew doctor<br />Warning: /usr/local/etc isn't writable.<br />This can happen if you "sudo make install" software that isn't managed by<br />by Homebrew. If a brew tries to write a file to this directory, the<br />install will fail during the link step.<br /><br />You should probably `chown` /usr/local/etc<br />xcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.<br />xcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.<br /><br />Warning: You have an outdated version of /usr/bin/install_name_tool installed.<br />This will cause binary package installations to fail.<br />This can happen if you install osx-gcc-installer or RailsInstaller.<br />To restore it, you must reinstall OS X or restore the binary from<br />the OS packages.<br /><br />Warning: Git could not be found in your PATH.<br />Homebrew uses Git for several internal functions, and some formulae use Git<br />checkouts instead of stable tarballs. You may want to install Git:<br />  brew install git<br /><br />Warning: No developer tools installed.<br />Install the Command Line Tools:<br />  xcode-select --install<br />xcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.<br /></code></pre> Indeed, several files/directories below '/usr/local' were created by Homebrew as user 'lombard':  <pre><code>Gerts-Mac-mini:src coder$ ls -l /usr/local<br />total 80<br />-rw-r--r--   1 lombard  admin   3158  5 Jun 09:16 CODEOFCONDUCT.md<br />-rw-r--r--   1 lombard  admin    687  5 Jun 09:16 CONTRIBUTING.md<br />drwxr-xr-x   4 lombard  admin    136 17 Jun 17:11 Cellar<br />-rw-r--r--   1 lombard  admin   1253  5 Jun 09:16 LICENSE.txt<br />drwxr-xr-x   9 lombard  admin    306 17 Jun 17:11 Library<br />-rw-r--r--   1 lombard  admin   1858  5 Jun 09:16 README.md<br />-rw-r--r--   1 lombard  admin  23719  5 Jun 09:16 SUPPORTERS.md<br />drwxrwxr-x  12 root     admin    408 17 Jun 17:11 bin<br />drwxr-xr-x   3 lombard  admin    102 17 Jun 17:11 etc<br />drwxrwxr-x   5 root     admin    170 17 Jun 17:11 lib<br />drwxr-xr-x   3 root     wheel    102 17 Jun 17:11 libexec<br />drwxrwxr-x   4 root     admin    136 17 Jun 17:11 share<br /></code></pre> I can't just use 'chown -R' because I only want to change the owner of some specific files. To recursively fix/change the owner only of files specifically owned by another user, use the versatile 'find' command:  <pre><code>$ find . -user lombard -exec sudo ch<br />own coder {} \;<br /></code></pre> Now I just took care of the other things that brew doctor complained about:  <pre><code>$ xcode-select --install<br />$ brew update<br /></code></pre> That's it! Now I'm ready to install more tools using Homebrew using the new user account.
