As a Microsoft SQL / MySQL developer I was surprised to find out today that Oracle doesn't support empty strings in "NOT NULL" fields!  This is because Oracle treats an empty string, i.e. '', the same as NULL.<br /><br />Of course this is old news to Oracle users, but even some of my colleagues who'd been using Oracle longer than me were unaware of this.<br /><br />I realized this after trying to figure out why an INSERT statement like the following kept complaining that column B cannot be NULL:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">insert into MYTABLE ( A, B ) values ( 'hello', '' )</span><br /><br />I think that's not very clever at all.<br /><br />That means, for example, if your code performs a search on a field, the following can never work:<br /><br />select * from MYTABLE where B = :value<br /><br />if the :value parameter is an empty string, since you'd have to say "where B is null" instead.<br /><br />Google "oracle empty string null" for more descriptions.
