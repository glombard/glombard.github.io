When you're using Dagger 2.0 in your Android projects, you'll quickly realize you need to include
an additional dependency to provide the `@Generated` annotation (from [JSR-250][JSR]). [**]

These are the common options typically seen in online Dagger examples:

1. javax.annotation:jsr250-api:1.0
2. org.glassfish:javax.annotation:10.0-b28
3. javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api:1.2

So which one should you use?

Let's do a quick comparison of the 3 jars:

1. [javax.annotation:jsr250-api:1.0][1]

    - Jar file size: 5.7kb
    - Date of javax directory: Apr 27, 2006
    - License: https://glassfish.java.net/public/CDDLv1.0.html
    - Created-By: 1.5.0_05-b05 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)

2. [org.glassfish:javax.annotation:10.0-b28][2]

    - Jar file size: 20kb
    - Date of javax directory: Oct 8, 2008
    - License: https://glassfish.dev.java.net/nonav/public/CDDL+GPL.html
    - Created-By: Apache Maven Bundle Plugin

3. [javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api:1.2][3]

    - Jar file size: 26kb
    - Date of javax directory: Apr 26, 2013
    - Created-By: Created-By: 1.7.0_09 (Oracle Corporation)
    - License: https://glassfish.dev.java.net/nonav/public/CDDL+GPL.html

So the second contains slightly more meta-data files and a different license (includes GPL) than the first option, but otherwise they contain essentially the same content - e.g. the same .class files.

The third one contains a few extra annotations, including: `@ManagedBean`, `@Priority`, but is pretty much the same as the second one.

Verdict: use the first/oldest one: javax.annotation:jsr250-api:1.0

Final note: when you include the dependency in your android project, use the `provided` scope instead of `compile`, to prevent the JSR-250 annotations from being distributed with your app, in other words:

    dependencies {
        compile 'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.0.1'
        provided 'javax.annotation:jsr250-api:1.0'
        apt 'com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.0.1'
    }

** PS. if you don't include one of these JSR-250 jars in your project, you'll get this compile error in one of the files generated by dagger-compiler:

    Error:(17, 24) error: package javax.annotation does not exist
    Error:(20, 2) error: cannot find symbol class Generated
    Error:(21, 14) error: dagger.internal.codegen.ComponentProcessor was unable to process this class because not all of its dependencies could be resolved. Check for compilation errors or a circular dependency with generated code.
