When you search for examples of reading a file on the web, most examples you see show: <br /><br /><pre><code>with open('file') as f:<br />  text = f.read()<br /></code></pre><br />But it's quite hard to find examples of the "correct" or "proper" way to read text files in Python. Of course correct/proper is a matter of opinion and depends on what you're trying to accomplish. In many cases you really want to slurp the full file into memory as above, but in my case I more often need to process one line at a time (perhaps in conjunction with a generator), in which case this is what I need: <br /><br /><pre><code>with open('file') as f:<br />  for line in f:<br />    yield line<br /></code></pre><br />Not to mention that you'd deal with binary files in a different way as well...
