After upgrading to OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) I had to do the following to get Android Studio working again:<br /><br /><ul><li>Update Xcode to the latest version</li><li>Activate the Xcode Command Line Tools license for example by running on the shell `sudo gcc` and accept the license. Now git should work.</li><li>Install Java 6 when prompted automatically after trying to launch Android Studio.</li><li>Need to update VirtualBox for <a href="http://www.genymotion.com/">Genymotion</a> to work. Use `Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager` to download the latest VirtualBox.</li></ul>
