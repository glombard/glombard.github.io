You don't call variable "x" in your C# code <code>xVariable</code> or <code>var_x</code>.<br /><br />You don't call a table "Products" in your database <code>ProductsTable</code> or <code>table_Products</code>.<br /><br />So why do you call your stored procedures <code><b>sp_</b>GetProducts</code>?<br /><br />Are prefixes really necessary in stored proc names?  Isn't it obvious enough that it's a stored procedure?<br /><br />Just wondering.<br /><br />(If you have to prefix your stored procs, don't use "sp" because then they appear to be system stored procs...)
