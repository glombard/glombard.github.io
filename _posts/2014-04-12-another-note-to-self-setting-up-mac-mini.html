<b><u>Sublime Text 3:</u></b><br /><b><u><br /></u></b>I'm using Sublime Text as my default editor on Mac and Windows (replaced Notepad++ about a year ago as my favourite editor on Windows). One of the things I like about Sublime is that the plugins are written in Python. I haven't tried creating my own plugin but I am trying to use Python more so this is one more thing to keep in mind.<br /><b><u><br /></u></b><b><u>Git:</u></b><br /><br />This time I'm not going to install the Xcode Command-Line Tools just to get git.<br /><br />Two easy alternatives seem to be:<br />1. Install GitHub for Mac and install the Git command-line from the Preferences menu<br />2. Use Homebrew to install git.<br /><br />I've opted for option 1. This installs the git binary to /usr/local/bin/git. You need to add the /usr/local/bin directory to your path.<br /><br />Next I installed SourceTree.<br /><br /><b><u>Terminal:</u></b><br /><br />I want a dark theme for the OSX Terminal and found:&nbsp;https://github.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized<br /><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized/master/Solarized%20Dark.terminal</span><br /><br />In Terminal, import the settings with Command+O and select the Solarized file. This gives me a basic dark theme. Not completely happy with it yet but it's a start.<br /><br />
