Hi There! I'm Gert Lombard, a computer nerd from South Africa now living in the San Francisco Bay Area.

I've had several "blogs" over the years since 1998. I've tried using Blogger, WordPress, Orchard CMS,
a self-hosted [website](https://web.archive.org/web/20021129130632/http://codeblast.com/~gert/) on RedHat linux with static html files (running from my living room), and before that [Xoom][xoom] and
[Tripod][tripod] in the early days. I hosted Radon [BBS](http://bbs.hmvh.net/lists/the_list.htm) (with a good friend of mine) way before the Internet even existed commercially in South Africa! :-)

Ever since the BBS days in the early 90's, I've liked the idea of having an online presence. The thing I just haven't figured out yet, is what exactly the point of this presence is! I think it's mostly to entertain myself and to collect a few random ideas to refer to later myself. If someone happens to come across a page here and finds it useful, that's awesome!

This here site is my current web presence. Thank you for looking! [Let me know](http://twitter.com/codeblast) if you have feedback, questions or ideas for me.
