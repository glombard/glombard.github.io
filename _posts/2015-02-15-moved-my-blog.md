Hi There! I'm Gert Lombard, a computer nerd from South Africa now living in the San Francisco Bay Area.

I've had several "blogs" over the years. I've tried using Blogger, WordPress, Orchard CMS,
self-hosted websites on RedHat linux with static html files, and [Xoom][xoom] and
[Tripod][tripod] in the early days.

This here site is my current web presence. Thank you for looking!
